### What is this repo?
This is a test from my university, we are a group from the same class and will make the app together.

### Install Python and the Python extension
The tutorial guides you through installing Python and using the extension. You must install a Python interpreter yourself separately from the extension. For a quick install, use [Python](python.org) and install the extension from the VS Code Marketplace.

#

##### Install the following libraries for running the app:
```
pip install cx-Oracle
pip install PySimpleGUI==4.59.0
```
